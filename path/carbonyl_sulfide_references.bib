  abstract  = "Atmospheric OCS abundances have been retrieved from infrared
               spectra measured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) MkIV
               Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer during 24
               balloon flights and during nearly 1100 days of ground-based
               observations since 1985. Our spectral fitting approach uses
               broad windows to enhance the precision and robustness of the
               retrievals. Since OCS has a vertical profile similar in shape to
               that of N2O, and since tropospheric N2O is very stable, we
               reference the OCS observations to those of N2O, measured
               simultaneously in the same air mass, to remove the effects of
               stratospheric transport, allowing a clearer assessment of
               secular changes in OCS. Balloon measurements reveal less than 5
               \% change in stratospheric OCS amounts over the past 25 years.
               Ground-based measurements reveal a springtime peak of
               tropospheric OCS, followed by a rapid early-summer decrease,
               similar to the behavior of CO2. This results in a peak-to-peak
               seasonal cycle of 5--6 \% of the total OCS column at northern
               mid-latitudes. In the long-term tropospheric OCS record, a 5 \%
               decrease is seen from 1990 to 2002, followed by a 5 \% increase

              1998. Sea surface concentrations of carbonyl sulfide (COS)
              exhibited a pronounced diel variation at low latitudes but no
              diel cycle at mid and high latitudes possibly because of oceanic
              fronts and the longer hydrolysis time constant in cold water. The

              areas. CS2 concentrations varied less than those of COS, and the
              highest concentrations were found in the North African upwelling
              area with decreasing concentrations both northward and southward
              of this maximum. Dimethylsulfide (DMS) had the largest

              primary production (GPP), we conducted an experiment to measure
              the simultaneous net transfer of COS and CO2 between the
              atmosphere and a growing wheat canopy, senesced wheat, and the
              harvested field (located in the Southern Great Plains of the
              U.S.) using the eddy covariance technique. We found that during
              the growing season, there was a strong uptake of COS by the
              canopy (roughly between −10 and −40 pmol m−2 s−1) with a strong
              diel signal that mirrored net CO2 fluxes. After senescence and

              the atmosphere (up to +40 pmol m−2 s−1) that exhibited a weaker

              the dynamics of COS are more complicated than once thought, but
              that it may still be possible to independently derive

              participates in some key reactions of the carbon cycle and thus
              holds great promise for studies of carbon cycle processes. Global
              monitoring networks and atmospheric sampling programs provide
              concurrent data on COS and CO2 concentrations in the free
              troposphere and atmospheric boundary layer over vegetated areas.
              Here we present a modeling framework for interpreting these data
              and illustrate what COS measurements might tell us about carbon
              cycle processes. We implemented mechanistic and empirical
              descriptions of leaf and soil COS uptake into a global carbon
              cycle model (SiB 3) to obtain new estimates of the COS land flux.
              We then introduced these revised boundary conditions to an
              atmospheric transport model (Parameterized Chemical Transport
              Model) to simulate the variations in the concentration of COS and
              CO2 in the global atmosphere. To balance the threefold increase
              in the global vegetation sink relative to the previous baseline
              estimate, we propose a new ocean COS source. Using a simple
              inversion approach, we optimized the latitudinal distribution of
              this ocean source and found that it is concentrated in the
              tropics. The new model is capable of reproducing the seasonal
              variation in atmospheric concentration at most background
              atmospheric sites. The model also reproduces the observed large
              vertical gradients in COS between the boundary layer and free
              troposphere. Using a simulation experiment, we demonstrate that
              comparing drawdown of CO2 with COS could provide additional
              constraints on differential responses of photosynthesis and
              respiration to environmental forcing. The separation of these two
              distinct processes is essential to understand the carbon cycle

                carbon and water exchange is the use of carbonyl sulfide (COS).
                COS is taken up by leaves via the same pathway as CO2, leading
                to a close coupling of vegetation COS and CO2 fluxes during
                photosynthesis. Therefore it has been proposed that the gross
                fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration can be quantified
                through the concurrent measurements of COS and CO2. A necessary
                requirement for this approach at ecosystem and continental
                scales are estimates of soil COS fluxes. Soil is largely
                considered a sink for COS, but our knowledge of in situ soil
                COS fluxes remains very limited. We measured soil COS fluxes in
                a wheat field in Oklahoma from April to June 2012, using a
                novel combination of an automated soil chamber coupled to a COS
                laser analyzer. We provide the first continuous record of soil
                COS fluxes under natural conditions, and report on a phenomenon
                that has not been observed before. In contrast to the majority
                of published results, we found that the agricultural soil was a
                strong source of COS under most conditions during the campaign.
                The COS flux over the study period was highly correlated with
                soil temperature. Up to a soil temperature of around 15°C, the
                soil acted as a COS sink. Above 15°C, it acted a source of COS,
                with fluxes of up to 25 pmol m-2 s-1. To locate the source of
                the COS production, we investigated different soil components.
                Wheat roots were found to be emitting COS under all conditions.
                Root-free soil was a COS sink up to a soil temperature of
                around 25°C, but turned into a COS source at higher soil
                temperatures. We also observed COS production from the roots of
                several other species, indicating that this may be a widespread
                phenomenon. Using eddy covariance data of COS and CO2 that was
                collected concurrently with the soil measurements, we also
                demonstrate how the soil COS source can be taken into account
                when partitioning net ecosystem exchange into photosynthesis
                and respiration",

              ratios of COS over Antarctica between 1650 and 1850 A.D. were
              substantially lower than those observed today. Specifically, the

              pmol mol−1 (ppt) during 1650--1850 A.D. and increases throughout
              most of the twentieth century. Measurements of COS in modern air

              ambient, annual mean mixing ratios between 480 and 490 ppt with

              CO2 has both sinks and sources within terrestrial ecosystems, but
              the primary terrestrial exchange for OCS is thought to be leaf
              uptake, suggesting potential for OCS uptake as a proxy for gross

              as a GPP proxy in micrometeorological studies of
              biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange by applying theoretical
              concepts from earlier OCS studies to estimate GPP. We partitioned
              measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using the ratio of measured
              vertical mole fraction gradients of OCS and CO2. At the Harvard
              Forest AmeriFlux site, measured CO2 and OCS vertical gradients

              OCS mole fraction gradients to provide indication of potential
              OCS signal magnitudes at sites where no OCS measurements were

              Using CA-deficient antisense lines of C4 and C3 plants, COS
              uptake was essentially eliminated and discrimination against
              C18OO exchange (18$\Delta$) greatly reduced, demonstrating CA's
              key role in both processes. 18$\Delta$ showed a positive linear
              correlation with leaf relative uptake (LRU; ratio of COS to CO2
              assimilation rates, As/Ac, normalized to their respective ambient

              $\pm$ 37.5 pmol m−2 s−1 for the planted waterlogged soil, which
              was significantly higher than that for the non-planted
              waterlogged soil (3.8 $\pm$ 2.8 pmol m−2 s−1). OCS and DMS

              all soils tested. However, the compensation concentrations (<166
              ng l-1; 1 ng OCS l-1=0.41 ppbv) that were calculated from the
              model were high relative to the ambient OCS concentration (ca.
              0.5 ppbv). The production rates (0.16--1.9 ng h-1 g-1 dw) that
              were actually measured when flushing the soil samples with air
              containing zero OCS were smaller than those (17--114 ng h-1 g-1
              dw) calculated from the model. This observation was explained by
              two different concepts: one assuming the existence of a threshold
              concentration (mt) below which OCS was no longer consumed in the
              soil; the other assuming the existence of two different OCS
              consumption processes, of which only the process active at
              elevated OCS concentrations was covered by the experiments. The
              latter concept allowed the estimation of OCS compensation
              concentrations that were partially low enough to allow the uptake
              of atmospheric OCS by soil. Both OCS production and uptake in PBE
              soil were dependent on soil temperature (optimum 20 °C)
              indicating a microbial process. However, both production and
              consumption of OCS were not consistently inhibited by
              sterilization of the soil, suggesting that they were not
              exclusively due to microbiological processes. Under anoxic
              conditions, OCS was also produced, but was not consumed except in
              one soil (RA). Production of OCS in the soils was stimulated
              after addition of thiocyanate, but not thiourea, thiosulfate,
              thioglycolate, tetrathionate, sulfate, elemental sulfur, cysteine
              and methionine.",

              shown that, in the course of this reaction, the active catalyst,
              the His3ZnOH structural motif, is converted to its hydrosulfide
              form: His3ZnOH+COS$\rightarrow$His3ZnSH+CO2. In this study, we
              elucidate the mechanism of reactivation of carbonic anhydrase

              calculations, a model reaction and in vivo experimental
              investigation. The desulfuration occurs according to the overall
              equation His3ZnSH+H2O ⇌ His3ZnOH+H2S. The initial step is a
              protonation equilibrium at the zinc-bound hydrosulfide. The

              molecule, which is subsequently deprotonated to yield the

              to enable a plant cell to expel H2S or rapidly metabolise it to

              discussed as a promising new approach for partitioning net
              ecosystem-scale CO2 fluxes into photosynthesis and respiration.
              The utility of COS for flux partitioning at the ecosystem scale
              critically depends on the understanding of non-leaf sources and
              sinks of COS. This study assessed the contribution of the soil to
              ecosystem-scale COS fluxes under simulated drought conditions at
              temperate grassland in the Central Alps. We used transparent
              steady-state flow-through chambers connected to a quantum cascade
              laser spectrometer to measure the COS and CO2 gas exchange
              between the soil surface and the atmosphere. Soils were a source
              of COS during the day, emissions being mainly driven by incoming
              solar radiation and to a lesser degree soil temperature. Soil
              water content had a negligible influence on soil COS exchange and
              thus the drought and control treatment were statistically not

              positive compared to the previous studies, which predominantly

              solar radiation. Our results suggest that abiotic drivers play a

  abstract = "Carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS), the most abundant
              sulfur-containing gas in the troposphere, has recently emerged as
              a potentially important atmospheric tracer for the carbon cycle.
              Atmospheric inverse modeling studies may be able to use existing
              tower, airborne, and satellite observations of COS to infer
              information about photosynthesis. However, such analysis relies
              on gridded anthropogenic COS source estimates that are largely
              based on industry activity data from over three decades ago. Here
              we use updated emission factor data and industry activity data to
              develop a gridded inventory with a 0.1° resolution for the U.S.
              domain. The inventory includes the primary anthropogenic COS
              sources including direct emissions from the coal and aluminum
              industries as well as indirect sources from industrial carbon
              disulfide emissions. Compared to the previously published
              inventory, we found that the total anthropogenic source (direct
              and indirect) is 47\% smaller. Using this new gridded inventory
              to drive the Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model/Weather
              Research and Forecasting atmospheric transport model, we found
              that the anthropogenic contribution to COS variation in the
              troposphere is small relative to the biosphere influence, which
              is encouraging for carbon cycle applications in this region.

              the main storage compartment and current hinge of sulfur in which
              98.4\% sulfur was accumulated, while only 1.6\% sulfur was

              of sulfur turnover through the compartments of the typical meadow
              C. angustifolia wetland ecosystem demonstrated that the

  abstract  = "Reduced sulfur gases are precursors to sulfate aerosols that act
               as cloud condensation nuclei and affect Earth's radiative
               balance. The diminishing anthropogenic atmospheric sulfur inputs
               due to long-standing acid rain abatement activities increase the
               influence of natural emissions on the remaining sulfur budget.
               Most previous terrestrial observations of reduced sulfur gas
               fluxes focus on wetland ecosystems where sulfur gas emissions
               are highest. The diffuse natural production of sulfur gas from
               more widespread oxic ecosystems needs to be characterized. Here
               we report in situ fluxes of sulfur gases and CO2 from grasslands
               outside of Santa Cruz, CA, USA (36.96°N, 122.08°W). Monthly
               measurements were made using static flux chambers from March
               2012 to March 2014. A large net emission of dimethyl sulfide
               (DMS) was observed during the growing season. During the
               non-growing dry season, small but quantifiable carbonyl sulfide
               (COS) exchange rates were correlated with soil temperature. When
               soil moisture was artificially increased in senescent grassland
               plots, the relative exchange of COS:CO2 increased and then
               returned to the original ratio within 2 h. Sulfur gas fluxes
               during wet season soil moisture transition events (i.e. after
               precipitation) indicate that understudied aerobic environments
               may provide an important contribution to atmospheric COS
               consumption and DMS production.",

              steady state because there is no significant observed trend or
              interannual variability in atmospheric OCS measurements. However,
              the magnitude and spatial distribution of the dominant ocean
              source are highly uncertain due to the lack of observations. In

              approximately 280 Gg S yr−1 to greater than 800 Gg S yr−1, with
              the larger flux needed to balance a similarly sized terrestrial
              sink that is inferred from NOAA continental sites. Here we

              and carbon monoxide (CO) in natural waters were studied by
              evaluating experimental results from different aqueous systems. A
              coupled photoproduction mechanism was observed operating on CO
              and OCS. For CO photoproduction, the presence of a carbonyl group
              is necessary, while for OCS, a source of reduced sulfur in
              addition to the carbonyl is required. An acyl radical is
              postulated to be the key intermediary for OCS and CO
              photoproduction while a sulfur-centered radical (thiyl or
              sulfhydryl radical) is likely to be the key species that reacts
              with acyl radicals to produce OCS. Laboratory experiments
              indicated that addition of reduced sulfur to seawater and
              subsequent irradiation leads to a decrease in CO and an increase
              in OCS photoproduction rates relative to original water.
              Furthermore, treatment of Suwannee fulvic acid (SFA) or Aldrich
              humic (AH) aqueous solutions with sodium borohydride (NaBH4)
              decreased photoproduction of CO compared to untreated samples. A

              potential pathways are proposed for the photoproduction of both

              In natural waters, the anti-correlation CO/OCS is likely to be

              on long-term atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) records, derived
              from ice-core, firn and ambient air samples. We interpret these
              records using a model that simulates changes in COS concentration
              according to changes in its sources and sinks-including a large
              sink that is related to GPP. We find that the observation-based
              COS record is most consistent with simulations of climate and the
              carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth
              century (31\% $\pm$ 5\% growth; mean $\pm$ 95\% confidence
              interval). Although this COS analysis does not directly constrain
              models of future GPP growth, it does provide a global-scale
              benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.",

  abstract = "Carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS), the most abundant
              sulfur-containing gas in the troposphere, has recently emerged as
              a potentially important atmospheric tracer for the carbon cycle.
              Atmospheric inverse modeling studies may be able to use existing
              tower, airborne, and satellite observations of COS to infer
              information about photosynthesis. However, such analysis relies
              on gridded anthropogenic COS source estimates that are largely
              based on industry activity data from over three decades ago. Here
              we use updated emission factor data and industry activity data to
              develop a gridded inventory with a 0.1° resolution for the U.S.
              domain. The inventory includes the primary anthropogenic COS
              sources including direct emissions from the coal and aluminum
              industries as well as indirect sources from industrial carbon
              disulfide emissions. Compared to the previously published
              inventory, we found that the total anthropogenic source (direct
              and indirect) is 47\% smaller. Using this new gridded inventory
              to drive the Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model/Weather
              Research and Forecasting atmospheric transport model, we found
              that the anthropogenic contribution to COS variation in the
              troposphere is small relative to the biosphere influence, which
              is encouraging for carbon cycle applications in this region.

  author   = "Lee, Chon-Lin and Brimblecombe, Peter",
  abstract = "Abstract Previous studies of the global sulfur cycle have focused
              almost exclusively on oxidized species and just a few sulfides.
              This focus is expanded here to include a wider range of reduced
              sulfur compounds. Inorganic sulfides tend to be bound into
              sediments, and sulfates are present both in sediments and the
              oceans. Sulfur can adopt polymeric forms that include SS bonds.
              This review examines the global anthropogenic sources of reduced
              sulfur, updating emission inventories and widening the
              consideration of industrial sources. It estimates the
              anthropogenic fluxes of key sulfides to the atmosphere (units Gg
              S a− 1) as: carbonyl sulfide (total 591: mainly from pulp and
              pigment 171, atmospheric oxidation of carbon disulfide 162,
              biofuel and coal combustion, 133, natural 898 Gg S a− 1), carbon
              disulfide (total 746: rayon 395, pigment 205, pulp 78, natural
              330 Gg S a− 1), methanethiol (total 2119: pulp 1680, manure 330,
              rayon and wastewater 102, natural 6473 Gg S a− 1), dimethyl
              sulfide (total 2197: pulp 1462, manure 660 and rayon 36, natural
              31,657 Gg S a− 1), dimethyl disulfide (total 1103: manure 660,
              pulp 273, natural 1081 Gg S a− 1). The study compares the
              magnitude of the natural sources: marine, vegetation and soils,
              volcanoes and rain water with the key anthropogenic sources:
              paper industry, rayon-cellulose manufacture, agriculture and
              pigment production. Industrial sources could be reduced by better
              pollution control, so their contribution may lessen over time.
              Anthropogenic emissions dominate the global budget of carbon
              disulfide, and some aromatic compounds such as thiophene, with
              emissions of methanethiol and dimethyl disulfide also relatively
              important. Furthermore, industries related to coal and bitumen
              are key sources of multi-ringed thiophenes, while food production
              and various wastes may account for the release of significant
              amounts of dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide.",

              volcano, Antarctica, renowned for its persistent lava lake. The
              observations were made in December 2005 both at source, with an
              infrared spectrometer sited on the crater rim, and up to 56 km
              downwind, using a Twin Otter aircraft; with the two different
              measurement platforms, plume ages were sampled ranging from <1
              min to as long as 9 h. Three species (CO, carbonyl sulfide (OCS),
              and SO2) were measured from both air and ground. While CO and OCS
              were conserved in the plume, consistent with their long
              atmospheric lifetimes, the downwind measurements indicate a
              SO2/CO ratio about 20\% of that observed at the crater rim,
              suggesting rapid chemical conversion of SO2. The aircraft
              measurements also identify volcanogenic H2SO4, HNO3 and,
              recognized for the first time in a volcanic plume, HO2NO2. We did
              not find NOx in the downwind plume despite previous detection of
              NO2 above the crater. This suggests that near-source NOx was
              quickly oxidized to HNO3 and HO2NO2, and probably NO32−(aq),
              possibly in tandem with the conversion of SO2 to sulfate. These
              fast processes may have been facilitated by ``cloud processing''
              in the dense plume immediately downwind from the crater. A
              further striking observation was O3 depletion of up to ∼35\% in
              parts of the downwind plume. This is likely to be due to the
              presence of reactive halogens (BrO and ClO) formed through
              heterogeneous processes in the young plume. Our analysis adds to
              the growing evidence for the tropospheric reactivity of volcanic
              plumes and shows that Erebus volcano has a significant impact on

              exchange processes of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) between soils and
              the atmosphere under laboratory conditions. The exchange patterns
              of OCS between soils and the atmosphere were found to be highly
              dependent on soil moisture and ambient CO2 concentration. With
              increasing soil moisture, OCS exchange ranged from emission under
              dry conditions to an uptake within an optimum moisture range,
              followed again by emission at high soil moisture. Elevated CO2
              was found to have a significant impact on the exchange rate and
              direction as tested with several soils. There is a clear tendency
              towards a release of OCS at higher CO2 levels (up to 7600 ppm),
              which are typical for the upper few centimeters within soils. At
              high soil moisture the release of OCS increased sharply.
              Measurements after chloroform vapor application show that there
              is a biotic component to the observed OCS exchange. Furthermore,
              soil treatment with the fungi inhibitor nystatin showed that
              fungi might be the dominant OCS consumers in the soils we
              examined. We discuss the influence of soil moisture and elevated
              CO2 on the OCS exchange as a change in the activity of microbial
              communities. Physical factors such as diffusivity that are
              governed by soil moisture also play a role. Comparing KM values

              that competitive inhibition is unlikely for Carbonic Anhydrase

               the CS2-producing tree Quercus lobata. Three of the isolates

               methylotrophic, and heterotrophic, and capable of growth on a
               wide range of inorganic and organic sulfur compounds.
               Biochemical and physiological properties differed slightly among
               the three strains, but all are proposed to be novel thiobacillus
               species. Growth yields on CS2 in batch and chemostat culture
               ranged from 3.3 g dry wt/mol CS2 (batch) to a maximum growth
               yield (Ymax) of 11.1 g dry wt/mol (chemostat). Chemostat data
               for two of the strains growing, autotrophically on thiosulfate
               gave Ymax values of 7.4 and 7.1 g dry wt/mol, which fall within
               the range observed with thiobacilli. The three new Thiobacillus
               strains had DNA containing 39.8 (KS2), 47.8 (KS1), and 50.5
               (KL1) mol\% G+C. All three were unusual in being able to grow
               not only on thiosulfate (aerobically or with denitrification),
               but also on CS2, carbonyl sulfide and methylated sulfides as
               sole energy substrates, and one was unique in being able to grow
               also on substituted thiophenes. They are the first organisms
               described to be capable, of anaerobic growth with
               denitrification on CS2. The fourth isolate (strain KL2) was
               gram-positive non-motile and nonspore-forming, with 39.0 mol\%
               G+C. It had a restricted range of sulfur-containing growth
               substrates, could not grow methylotrophically or on autotrophic
               substrates other than CS2, and is not yet classifiable These
               organisms extend the range of eubacteria known to be capable of

              within the $\beta$-CA family. Unlike CAs, the CS(2) hydrolases
              did not hydrate CO(2) but converted CS(2) and COS with H(2)O to

  abstract = "Carbonyl sulfide (COS) in air and dissolved in seawater was
              determined during a cruise in August 1999 in the Sargasso Sea in
              the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Dissolved concentrations at the sea
              surface displayed only a weak diel cycle with a mean of
              8.6$\pm$2.8 pmol dm−3 owing to low abundance of photochemical
              precursors and high temperatures causing rapid hydrolysis. Depth
              profiles measured over the oceanic mixed layer revealed
              significant vertical gradients of COS concentration with higher
              values at the surface, suggesting that the rate of photochemical
              production at the surface exceeds the rate of vertical mixing.
              The mean atmospheric mixing ratio was 486$\pm$40 ppt, and
              calculated sea-air fluxes ranged from 0.03 to 0.8 g COS km−2 d−1.
              COS dark production, estimated from the predawn COS concentration
              at the surface and the hydrolysis constant, contributed
              significantly to the total amount of COS produced. A strong
              temperature dependence of the COS dark production rate q was
              found by comparing previously published values. The data further
              indicate an approximately first-order relationship between q and
              chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbance at 350
              nm, a350, which is used as a proxy for the CDOM content of the
              water but is likely to covary with other parameters, such as
              biological activity, that could also affect COS dark production.
              Together with known functions for COS hydrolysis and solubility,
              the parameterization of dark production as a function of
              temperature and a350 allows for the prediction of COS
              concentrations and saturation ratios as a function of physical
              and optical seawater properties in the absence of
              photoproduction. This is used to estimate a lower limit of 0.056

              variety of substrates in addition to N2 and protons. General
              properties of alternative substrates for nitrogenase are the
              presence of N-N, N-O, N-C, and C-C triple or double bonds. In the
              present work, we demonstrate that Azotobacter vinelandii
              nitrogenase can reduce both C-S and C-O bonds. Nitrogenase was
              found to reduce carbonyl sulfide (COS), to CO and H2S at a
              maximum rate of 37.2 +/- 2.0 nmol min-1 (mg of protein)-1 with a
              Km of 3.1 +/- 0.6 mM. The formation of CO from nitrogenase
              reduction of COS was monitored spectrophotometrically in real
              time by following the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In this
              assay, the change in the visible absorption spectrum of reduced
              hemoglobin upon binding CO provided a sensitive way to quantify
              CO formation and to remove CO, which is a potent inhibitor of
              nitrogenase, from solution. COS reduction by nitrogenase required
              the molybdenum-iron protein (MoFeP), the iron protein (FeP), and
              MgATP. The reduction reaction was inhibited by MgADP, acetylene,
              and N2, while H2 was not an inhibitor of COS reduction. The pH
              optimum for COS reduction was 6.5. Nitrogenase was also found to
              reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to CO and H2O. CO2 was reduced at a
              maximum rate of 0.8 +/- 0.07 nmole min-1 (mg of protein)-1 with a

               the use of COS as a tracer for gross primary productivity (GPP).
               In this study we derived nighttime COS fluxes in a boreal forest
               (the SMEAR II station in Hyyti{\"a}l{\"a}, Finland; 61°51′ N,
               24°17′ E; 181 m a.s.l.) from June to November 2015 using two
               different methods: eddy-covariance (EC) measurements (FCOS-EC)
               and the radon-tracer method (FCOS-Rn). The total nighttime COS
               fluxes averaged over the whole measurement period were −6.8
               $\pm$ 2.2 and −7.9 $\pm$ 3.8 pmol m−2 s−1 for FCOS-Rn and
               FCOS-EC, respectively, which is 33--38 \% of the average daytime
               fluxes and 21 \% of the total daily COS uptake. The correlation
               of 222Rn (of which the source is the soil) with COS (average R2
               = 0.58) was lower than with CO2 (0.70), suggesting that the main
               sink of COS is not located at the ground. These observations are
               supported by soil chamber measurements that show that soil
               contributes to only 34--40 \% of the total nighttime COS uptake.
               We found a decrease in COS uptake with decreasing nighttime
               stomatal conductance and increasing vapor-pressure deficit and
               air temperature, driven by stomatal closure in response to a
               warm and dry period in August. We also discuss the effect that
               canopy layer mixing can have on the radon-tracer method and the
               sensitivity of (FCOS-EC) to atmospheric turbulence. Our results
               suggest that the nighttime uptake of COS is mainly driven by the
               tree foliage and is significant in a boreal forest, such that it
               needs to be taken into account when using COS as a tracer for

               terrestrial photosynthesis. To infer ecosystem-scale
               photosynthesis from COS fluxes often requires knowledge of leaf
               relative uptake (LRU), the concentration-normalized ratio
               between leaf COS uptake and photosynthesis. However, current
               mechanistic understanding of LRU variability remains inadequate
               for deriving robust COS-based estimates of photosynthesis. We
               derive a set of closed-form equations to describe LRU responses
               to light, humidity and CO2 based on the Ball-Berry stomatal
               conductance model and the biochemical model of photosynthesis.
               This framework reproduces observed LRU responses: decreasing LRU
               with increasing light or decreasing humidity; it also predicts
               that LRU increases with ambient CO2 . By fitting the LRU
               equations to flux measurements on a C3 reed (Typha latifolia),
               we obtain physiological parameters that control LRU variability,
               including an estimate of the Ball-Berry slope of 7.1 without
               using transpiration measurements. Sensitivity tests reveal that
               LRU is more sensitive to photosynthetic capacity than to the
               Ball-Berry slope, indicating stomatal response to
               photosynthesis. This study presents a simple framework for
               interpreting observed LRU variability and upscaling LRU. The
               stoma-regulated LRU response to CO2 suggests that COS may offer

              Atlantic shelf during summer 1990. Concentrations of OCS in shelf
              waters averaged 0.4 nmol l−1, whereas estuarine concentrations
              ranged from 0.3 to 12.1 nmol l−1. In anoxic waters, OCS
              concentrations increased sharply, and porewater concentrations
              exceeded 7000 nmol l−1. The mechanisms leading to the production
              of OCS in sediments have not been identified, but include organic
              matter regeneration, pyrite oxidation, and sulfate reduction.
              Elevated OCS concentrations in estuaries must be due to a balance
              between production by the photolysis of dissolved organic sulfur
              compounds and sediment-water exchange, and losses by sea-air
              exchange and hydrolysis. Sea-air fluxes of OCS from estuarine and

               carbonyl sulfide (COS), a trace gas which is involved in
               building up the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer, is taken up
               by vegetation with the same triad of the enzymes which are
               metabolizing CO2, i.e. ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
               carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
               (PEP-Co) and carbonic anhydrase (CA). Therefore, we discuss a
               physiological/biochemical acclimation of these enzymes affecting
               the sink strength of vegetation for COS. We investigated the
               acclimation of two European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and
               Quercus ilex, grown inside chambers under elevated CO2, and
               determined the exchange characteristics and the content of CA
               after a 1--2 yr period of acclimation from 350 ppm to 800 ppm
               CO2. We demonstrate that a compensation point, by definition,
               does not exist. Instead, we propose to discuss a point of uptake
               affinity (PUA). The results indicate that such a PUA, the CA
               activity and the deposition velocities may change and may cause
               a decrease of the COS uptake by plant ecosystems, at least as
               long as the enzyme acclimation to CO2 is not surpassed by an
               increase of atmospheric COS. As a consequence, the atmospheric
               COS level may rise causing an increase of the radiative forcing
               in the troposphere. However, this increase is counterbalanced by
               the stronger input of this trace gas into the stratosphere
               causing a stronger energy reflection by the stratospheric sulfur
               aerosol into space (Br{\"u}hl et al., 2012). These data are very
               preliminary but may trigger a discussion on COS uptake

              tracer for the carbon cycle. Gridded inventories of global
              anthropogenic COS are used for interpreting global COS
              measurements. However, previous gridded anthropogenic data are a
              climatological estimate based on input data that is over three
              decades old and are not representative of current conditions.
              Here we develop a new gridded data set of global anthropogenic
              COS sources that includes more source sectors than previously
              available and uses the most current emissions factors and
              industry activity data as input. Additionally, the inventory is
              provided as annually varying estimates from years 1980--2012 and
              employs a source specific spatial scaling procedure. We estimate
              a global source in year 2012 of 406 Gg S y−1 (range of 223--586
              Gg S y−1), which is highly concentrated in China and is twice as
              large as the previous gridded inventory. Our large upward
              revision in the bottom-up estimate of the source is consistent
              with a recent top-down estimate based on air-monitoring and
              Antarctic firn data. Furthermore, our inventory time trends,
              including a decline in the 1990's and growth after the year 2000,
              are qualitatively consistent with trends in atmospheric data.
              Finally, similarities between the spatial distribution in this

               plants consume atmospheric OCS via their stomatal pores in
               proportion with CO2 photosynthesis and that soil fluxes of OCS
               are negligible in comparison. Recent soil-centered studies
               demonstrate that soils can produce OCS and contribute as much as
               a quarter of the atmospheric terrestrial flux. Despite the
               potential widespread importance of soil OCS emissions,
               insufficient data exist to predict variations in OCS production
               across ecosystems, and the chemical and biological drivers of
               OCS production are virtually unknown. In this study, we address
               this knowledge gap by investigating variables controlling OCS
               soil production including soil physical and chemical properties,
               microbial community composition, and sulfur speciation in two
               independent surveys. We found that soil OCS production was
               nearly ubiquitous across the 58 sites, increased exponentially
               with temperature, and was insensitive to visible light
               conditioning. Soil pH, N, and C/N were predictors of OCS soil

               during photosynthesis, namely carbonic anhydrase (CA) and
               RuBisCO, where CA is the more important one. The majority of
               sources of OCS to the atmosphere are geographically separated
               from this large plant sink, whereas the sources and sinks of CO2

              Measurements revealed large vertical gradients in OCS, from which

              ratios at all heights exhibited a typical pattern characterized
              by nighttime drawdown, an early morning minimum, and a maximum of
              OCS around midday. Daytime increase in the upper canopy is
              attributed to entrainment of planetary boundary layer air into
              the canopy. The ecosystem was found to be a large daytime sink of

               uniform in space and time. Homogeneous spatiotemporal coverage
               is essentially impossible to achieve. Solar occultation
               measurements, by virtue of satellite orbit and the requirement
               of direct observation of the sun through the atmosphere, result
               in particularly sparse spatial coverage. In this
               proof-of-concept study, a method is presented to adjust for such
               sampling biases when calculating climatological means. The
               method is demonstrated using carbonyl sulfide (OCS) measurements
               at 16 km altitude from the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry
               Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer). At this altitude,
               OCS mixing ratios show a steep gradient between the poles and
               Equator. ACE-FTS measurements, which are provided as vertically
               resolved profiles, and integrated stratospheric OCS columns are
               used in this study. The bias adjustment procedure requires no
               additional information other than the satellite data product
               itself. In particular, the method does not rely on atmospheric
               models with potentially unreliable transport or chemistry
               parameterizations, and the results can be used uncompromised to
               test and validate such models. It is expected to be generally
               applicable when constructing climatologies of long-lived tracers
               from sparsely and heterogeneously sampled satellite
               measurements. In the first step of the adjustment procedure, a
               regression model is used to fit a 2-D surface to all available
               ACE-FTS OCS measurements as a function of day-of-year and
               latitude. The regression model fit is used to calculate an
               adjustment factor that is then used to adjust each measurement
               individually. The mean of the adjusted measurement points of a
               chosen latitude range and season is then used as the bias-free
               climatological value. When applying the adjustment factor to
               seasonal averages in 30∘ zones, the maximum spatiotemporal
               sampling bias adjustment was 11 \% for OCS mixing ratios at 16
               km and 5 \% for the stratospheric OCS column. The adjustments
               were validated against the much denser and more homogeneous OCS
               data product from the limb-sounding MIPAS (Michelson
               Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) instrument, and
               both the direction and magnitude of the adjustments were in
               agreement with the adjustment of the ACE-FTS data.",

  abstract  = "Abstract. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is an emerging tracer to
               constrain land photosynthesis at canopy to global scales,
               because leaf COS and CO2 uptake processes are linked through
               stomatal diffusion. The COS tracer approach requires knowledge
               of the concentration normalized ratio of COS uptake to
               photosynthesis, commonly known as the leaf relative uptake
               (LRU). LRU is known to increase under low light, but the
               environmental controls over LRU variability in the field are
               poorly understood due to scant leaf scale observations. Here we
               present the first direct observations of LRU responses to
               environmental variables in the field. We measured leaf COS and
               CO2 fluxes at a freshwater marsh in summer 2013. Daytime leaf
               COS and CO2 uptake showed similar peaks in the mid-morning and
               late afternoon separated by a prolonged midday depression,
               highlighting the common stomatal control on diffusion. At night,
               in contrast to CO2, COS uptake continued, indicating partially
               open stomata. LRU ratios showed a clear relationship with
               photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), converging to 1.0 at
               high PAR, while increasing sharply at low PAR. Daytime
               integrated LRU (calculated from daytime mean COS and CO2 uptake)
               ranged from 1 to 1.5, with a mean of 1.2 across the campaign,
               significantly lower than the previously reported laboratory mean
               value (∼ 1.6). Our results indicate two major determinants of
               LRU -- light and vapor deficit. Light is the primary driver of
               LRU because CO2 assimilation capacity increases with light,
               while COS consumption capacity does not. Superimposed upon the
               light response is a secondary effect that high vapor deficit
               further reduces LRU, causing LRU minima to occur in the
               afternoon, not at noon. The partial stomatal closure induced by
               high vapor deficit suppresses COS uptake more strongly than CO2
               uptake because stomatal resistance is a more dominant component
               in the total resistance of COS. Using stomatal conductance
               estimates, we show that LRU variability can be explained in
               terms of different patterns of stomatal vs. internal limitations
               on COS and CO2 uptake. Our findings illustrate the
               stomata-driven coupling of COS and CO2 uptake during the most
               photosynthetically active period in the field and provide an in
               situ characterization of LRU -- a key parameter required for the
               use of COS as a photosynthetic tracer.",

              monitoring networks and atmospheric sampling programs provide
              concurrent data on COS and CO2 concentrations in the free
              troposphere and atmospheric boundary layer over vegetated areas.
              Here we present a modeling framework for interpreting these data
              and illustrate what COS measurements might tell us about carbon
              cycle processes. We implemented mechanistic and empirical
              descriptions of leaf and soil COS uptake into a global carbon
              cycle model (SiB 3) to obtain new estimates of the COS land flux.
              We then introduced these revised boundary conditions to an
              atmospheric transport model (Parameterized Chemical Transport
              Model) to simulate the variations in the concentration of COS and
              CO2 in the global atmosphere. To balance the threefold increase
              in the global vegetation sink relative to the previous baseline
              estimate, we propose a new ocean COS source. Using a simple
              inversion approach, we optimized the latitudinal distribution of
              this ocean source and found that it is concentrated in the

              variation in atmospheric concentration at most background

              vertical gradients in COS between the boundary layer and free

              comparing drawdown of CO2 with COS could provide additional

  abstract  = "Abstract. Land surface modelers need measurable proxies to
               constrain the quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilated by
               continental plants through photosynthesis, known as Gross
               Primary Production (GPP). Carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is taken
               up by leaves through their stomates and then hydrolysed by
               photosynthetic enzymes, is a candidate GPP proxy. A former study
               with the ORCHIDEE land surface model used a fixed ratio of COS
               uptake to CO2 uptake normalized to respective ambient
               concentrations for each vegetation type (Leaf Relative Uptake,
               LRU). COS leaf fluxes were then computed from GPP, and the
               resulting concentrations were transported with an atmospheric
               model which included all other known COS fluxes as inputs.
               Modelled COS concentrations could then be compared to COS
               measurements from the NOAA air sampling tower network. The LRU
               approach is known to have limited accuracy since the LRU ratio
               changes with variables such as Photosynthetically Active
               Radiation (PAR): while CO2 uptake slows under low light, COS
               uptake is not light limited. However, the LRU approach has been
               popular for COS-GPP proxy studies because of its ease of
               application and apparent low contribution to uncertainty for
               regional scale applications. In this study we refined the
               COS-GPP relationship and implemented in ORCHIDEE a mechanistic
               model that describes COS uptake by continental vegetation. We
               compared the simulated COS fluxes against measured hourly COS
               fluxes at two sites, and studied the model behaviour and links
               with environmental drivers. We performed simulations at global
               scale, and estimated the global COS uptake by vegetation to be
               −756 Gg S yr−1, in the middle range of former studies (−490 to
               −1335 Gg S yr−1). Based on the mechanistic approach in ORCHIDEE,
               we derived new LRU values for the different vegetation types,
               ranging between 0.92 and 1.72, close to recently published
               averages for observed values of 1.21 for C4 and 1.68 for C3
               plants. We transported the COS using the monthly vegetation COS
               fluxes derived from both the mechanistic and the LRU approaches,
               and evaluated the simulated COS concentrations at NOAA sites.
               Although the mechanistic approach was more appropriate when
               comparing to high-temporal-resolution COS flux measurements,
               both approaches gave similar results when transporting with
               monthly COS fluxes and evaluating COS concentrations at
               stations. In our study, uncertainties between these two
               approaches are of second importance as compared to the
               uncertainties in the COS global budget, which are currently a
               limiting factor to the potential of COS concentrations to
               constrain GPP simulated by land surface models on the global
               scale.",

               go? Currently, ocean and land systems remove about half of the
               CO2 emitted by human activities; the remainder stays in the
               atmosphere. These removal processes are sensitive to feedbacks
               in the energy, carbon, and water cycles that will change in the
               future. Observing how much carbon is taken up on land through
               photosynthesis is complicated because carbon is simultaneously
               respired by plants, animals, and microbes. Global observations
               from satellites and air samples suggest that natural ecosystems
               take up about as much CO2 as they emit. To match the data, our
               land models generate imaginary Earths where carbon uptake and
               respiration are roughly balanced, but the absolute quantities of
               carbon being exchanged vary widely. Getting the magnitude of the
               flux is essential to make sure our models are capturing the
               right pattern for the right reasons. Combining two cutting-edge
               tools, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and solar-induced fluorescence
               (SIF), will help develop an independent answer of how much
               carbon is being taken up by global ecosystems. Photosynthesis
               requires CO2, light, and water. OCS provides a spatially and
               temporally integrated picture of the ``front door'' of
               photosynthesis, proportional to CO2 uptake and water loss
               through plant stomata. SIF provides a high-resolution snapshot
               of the ``side door,'' scaling with the light captured by leaves.
               These two independent pieces of information help us understand
               plant water and carbon exchange. A coordinated effort to
               generate SIF and OCS data through satellite, airborne, and
               ground observations will improve our process-based models to
               predict how these cycles will change in the future.",

               ability to measure the efficacy of such measures is still not
               properly addressed. There is still a high degree of uncertainty
               in determining the contribution of the vegetation signal, which
               furthermore confounds the use of CO2 mole fraction measurements

               layer height and entrainment are driving the diurnal changes in
               OCS and CO2 at the downwind Sandia site. However, the STEM model

              measurements at Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF), a suburban site near Paris
              (France). Over a period of four and a half years, hourly
              measurements at 7 m above ground level were performed by gas
              chromatography and combined with 222Radon measurements to
              calculate nocturnal COS fluxes using the Radon-Tracer Method. In
              addition, the vertical distribution of COS was investigated at a
              second site, 2 km away from GIF, where a fast gas analyzer
              deployed on a 100 m tower for several months during winter
              2015-2016 recorded mixing ratios at 3 heights (15, 60 and 100 m).
              COS appears to be homogeneously distributed both horizontally and
              vertically in the sampling area. The main finding is that the
              area is a persistent COS sink even during wintertime episodes of
              strong pollution. Nighttime net uptake rates ranged from -1.5 to
              -32.8 pmol m-2 s-1, with an average of -7.3 $\pm$ 4.5 pmol m-2
              s-1 (n = 253). However, episodes of biogenic emissions happened
              each year in June-July (11.9 $\pm$ 6.2 pmol m-2 s-1, n = 24).
              Preliminary analyses of simulated footprints of source areas

               a 33\% decline in California coastal fog over the 20th century.
               However, ecosystem-scale measurements of photosynthesis and
               stomatal conductance are challenging in coast redwood forests,
               making it difficult to anticipate the impacts of future changes
               in fog. To address this methodological problem, we explore
               coastal variations in atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS),
               which could potentially be used as a tracer of these ecosystem
               processes. We conducted atmospheric flask campaigns in coast
               redwood sites, sampling at surface heights and in the canopy
               (~70 m), at the University of California Landels-Hill Big Creek

               persistent daytime drawdown between the coast and the downwind

               relationship between COS plant uptake, stomatal conductance, and
               gross primary production. Other sources and sinks of COS that
               could introduce noise to the COS tracer technique (soils,
               anthropogenic activity, nocturnal plant uptake, and surface
               hydrolysis on leaves) are likely to be small relative to daytime
               COS plant uptake. These results suggest that COS measurements

               models requires an accurate representation of biosphere COS
               fluxes, but these models have not been extensively evaluated
               against field observations of COS fluxes. In this paper, the COS
               flux as simulated by the Simple Biosphere Model, version 4
               (SiB4) is updated with the latest mechanistic insights and
               evaluated with site observations from different biomes: one
               evergreen needleleaf forest, two deciduous broadleaf forests,
               three grasslands, and two crop fields spread over Europe and
               North America. To account for the effect of atmospheric COS mole
               fractions on COS biosphere uptake, we replaced the fixed COS
               mole fraction originally used in SiB4 with spatially and
               temporally varying COS mole fraction fields. The lower COS mole
               fractions in the late growing season reduces COS uptake rates in
               agreement with observations. We also replaced the empirical soil
               COS uptake model in SiB4 with a mechanistic model that
               represents both uptake and production of COS in soils, which
               improves the match with observations over agricultural fields
               and fertilized grassland soils. SiB4 was capable of simulating
               the diurnal and seasonal variation of COS fluxes in the boreal,
               temperate and Mediterranean region. The daytime vegetation COS
               flux is on average 8 $\pm$ 27 \% underestimated, albeit with
               large variability across sites. On a global scale, our model
               modifications caused a drop in the COS biosphere sink from 922
               Gg S yr−1 in the original SiB4 model to 753 Gg S yr−1 in the
               updated version. The largest drop in fluxes was driven by lower
               atmospheric COS mole fractions over regions with high
               productivity, which highlights the importance of accounting for
               variations in atmospheric COS mole fractions. The change to a
               different soil model, on the other hand, had a relatively small
               effect on the global biosphere COS sink. The small role of the
               modeled soil component in the COS budget supports the use of COS
               as a global photosynthesis tracer.",

              COS fluxes exceeded +110 pmol m−2 s−1 for non-inundated plots

               (OCS) is key to its use as a tracer of ecosystem function.
               Underlying its application is the observation that vascular
               plants consume atmospheric OCS via their stomatal pores in
               proportion with CO2 photosynthesis and that soil fluxes of OCS
               are negligible in comparison. Recent soil-centered studies
               demonstrate that soils can produce OCS and contribute as much as
               a quarter of the atmospheric terrestrial flux. Despite the
               potential widespread importance of soil OCS emissions,
               insufficient data exist to predict variations in OCS production
               across ecosystems, and the chemical and biological drivers of
               OCS production are virtually unknown. In this study, we address
               this knowledge gap by investigating variables controlling OCS
               soil production including soil physical and chemical properties,
               microbial community composition, and sulfur speciation in two
               independent surveys. We found that soil OCS production was
               nearly ubiquitous across the 58 sites, increased exponentially
               with temperature, and was insensitive to visible light
               conditioning. Soil pH, N, and C/N were predictors of OCS soil
               production rates in both soil surveys. Patterns in soil S

               pointed to S-containing amino acids such as cysteine and
               methionine and their derivatives as potential precursors for OCS
               production. Elevated sulfate levels were associated with OCS
               production in some soils. This study provides new mechanistic
               insight into OCS production in soils and presents strategies to
               represent soil OCS fluxes that facilitate the use of OCS as a

  abstract  = "Abstract. Carbonyl Sulphide (COS), a trace gas showing striking
               similarity to CO2 in terms of biochemical diffusion pathway into
               leaves, has been recognized as a promising indicator of the
               plant gross primary production (GPP), the amount of carbon
               dioxide that is absorbed through photosynthesis by terrestrial
               ecosystems. However, large uncertainties about the other
               components of its atmospheric budget prevent us from directly
               relating the atmospheric COS measurements to GPP. The largest
               uncertainty comes from the closure of its atmospheric budget,
               with a source component missing. Here, we explore the benefit of
               assimilating both COS and CO2 measurements into the LMDz
               atmospheric transport model to obtain consistent information on
               GPP, plant respiration and COS budget. To this end, we develop
               an analytical inverse system that optimizes biospheric fluxes
               for the 15 plant functional types (PFTs) defined in the ORCHIDEE
               global land surface model. Plant uptake of COS is parameterized
               as a linear function of GPP of the leaf relative uptake (LRU),
               which is the ratio of COS to CO2 deposition velocities in
               plants. A possible scenario for the period 2008--2019 leads to a
               global biospheric sink of 800 GgS.yr−1, with higher absorption
               in the high latitudes and higher oceanic emissions between 400
               and 600 GgS.yr−1 most of which is located in the tropics. As for
               the CO2 budget, the inverse system increases GPP in the high
               latitudes by a few GtC.yr−1 without modifying the respiration
               compared to the ORCHIDEE fluxes used as a prior. In contrast, in
               the tropics the system tends to weaken both respiration and GPP.
               The optimized components of the COS and CO2 have been evaluated
               against independent measurements over Northern America, the
               Pacific Ocean, at three sites in Japan and at one site in
               France. Overall, the posterior COS concentrations are in better
               agreement with the COS retrievals at 250 hPa from the MIPAS
               satellite and with airborne measurements made over North America
               and the Pacific Ocean. The system seems to have rightly
               corrected the underestimated GPP over the high latitudes.
               However, the change in seasonality of GPP in the tropics
               disagrees with Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) data. The
               decline in biospheric sink in the Amazon driven by the inversion
               also disagrees with MIPAS COS retrievals at 250 hPa,
               highlighting the lack of observational constraints in this
               region. Moreover, the comparison with the surface measurements
               in Japan and France suggests misplaced sources in the prior
               anthropogenic inventory, emphasizing the need for an improved
               inventory to better partition oceanic and continental sources in
               Asia and Europe.",

  abstract = "In the Arctic and Boreal region (ABR) where warming is especially
              pronounced, the increase of gross primary production (GPP) has
              been suggested as an important driver for the increase of the
              atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA). However, the role
              of GPP relative to changes in ecosystem respiration (ER) remains
              unclear, largely due to our inability to quantify these gross
              fluxes on regional scales. Here, we use atmospheric carbonyl
              sulfide (COS) measurements to provide observation-based estimates
              of GPP over the North American ABR. Our annual GPP estimate is
              3.6 (2.4 to 5.5) PgC · y-1 between 2009 and 2013, the uncertainty
              of which is smaller than the range of GPP estimated from
              terrestrial ecosystem models (1.5 to 9.8 PgC · y-1). Our
              COS-derived monthly GPP shows significant correlations in space
              and time with satellite-based GPP proxies, solar-induced
              chlorophyll fluorescence, and near-infrared reflectance of
              vegetation. Furthermore, the derived monthly GPP displays two
              different linear relationships with soil temperature in spring
              versus autumn, whereas the relationship between monthly ER and
              soil temperature is best described by a single quadratic
              relationship throughout the year. In spring to midsummer, when
              GPP is most strongly correlated with soil temperature, our
              results suggest the warming-induced increases of GPP likely
              exceeded the increases of ER over the past four decades. In
              autumn, however, increases of ER were likely greater than GPP due
              to light limitations on GPP, thereby enhancing autumn net carbon
              emissions. Both effects have likely contributed to the
              atmospheric CO2 SCA amplification observed in the ABR.",

               the crop-dominated Midwest, evergreen-dominated South, and

               summer throughout the eastern US, driven by stomatal

               CO2 and COS depletion in late summer. The unprecedented

  abstract  = "Abstract. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is an atmospheric trace gas of
               interest for C cycle research because COS uptake by continental
               vegetation is strongly related to terrestrial gross primary
               productivity (GPP), the largest and most uncertain flux in
               atmospheric CO2 budgets. However, to use atmospheric COS as an
               additional tracer of GPP, an accurate quantification of COS
               exchange by soils is also needed. At present, the atmospheric
               COS budget is unbalanced globally, with total COS flux estimates
               from oxic and anoxic soils that vary between −409 and −89 GgS
               yr−1. This uncertainty hampers the use of atmospheric COS
               concentrations to constrain GPP estimates through atmospheric
               transport inversions. In this study we implemented a mechanistic
               soil COS model in the ORCHIDEE (Organising Carbon and Hydrology
               In Dynamic Ecosystems) land surface model to simulate COS fluxes
               in oxic and anoxic soils. Evaluation of the model against flux
               measurements at seven sites yields a mean root mean square
               deviation of 1.6 pmol m−2 s−1, instead of 2 pmol m−2 s−1 when
               using a previous empirical approach that links soil COS uptake
               to soil heterotrophic respiration. However, soil COS model
               evaluation is still limited by the scarcity of observation sites
               and long-term measurement periods, with all sites located in a
               latitudinal band between 39 and 62∘ N and no observations during
               wintertime in this study. The new model predicts that, globally
               and over the 2009--2016 period, oxic soils act as a net uptake
               of −126 GgS yr−1 and anoxic soils are a source of +96 GgS yr−1,
               leading to a global net soil sink of only −30 GgS yr−1, i.e.
               much smaller than previous estimates. The small magnitude of the
               soil fluxes suggests that the error in the COS budget is
               dominated by the much larger fluxes from plants, oceans, and
               industrial activities. The predicted spatial distribution of
               soil COS fluxes, with large emissions from oxic (up to 68.2 pmol
               COS m−2 s−1) and anoxic (up to 36.8 pmol COS m−2 s−1) soils in
               the tropics, especially in India and in the Sahel region,
               marginally improves the latitudinal gradient of atmospheric COS
               concentrations, after transport by the LMDZ (Laboratoire de
               M{\'e}t{\'e}orologie Dynamique) atmospheric transport model. The
               impact of different soil COS flux representations on the
               latitudinal gradient of the atmospheric COS concentrations is
               strongest in the Northern Hemisphere. We also implemented
               spatiotemporal variations in near-ground atmospheric COS
               concentrations in the modelling of biospheric COS fluxes, which
               helped reduce the imbalance of the atmospheric COS budget by
               lowering soil COS uptake by 10 \% and plant COS uptake by 8 \%
               globally (with a revised mean vegetation budget of −576 GgS yr−1
               over 2009--2016). Sensitivity analyses highlighted the different
               parameters to which each soil COS flux model is the most
               responsive, selected in a parameter optimization framework.
               Having both vegetation and soil COS fluxes modelled within
               ORCHIDEE opens the way for using observed ecosystem COS fluxes
               and larger-scale atmospheric COS mixing ratios to improve the
               simulated GPP, through data assimilation techniques.",

               that non-stomatal OCS fluxes are well constrained. OCS is taken
               up through plant leaves, following the same pathway as CO2; in
               contrast to CO2, OCS is irreversibly destroyed in plant leaves
               and plants do not typically exhibit OCS emissions. Ecosystem
               uptake of OCS can indicate changes in stomatal opening. Here we
               present an empirical model to assess the potential impact of
               soil OCS exchange, the non-Stomatal OCS exchange Empirical Model
               (SOCSEM, version 0). We created biome-specific response curves
               characterizing soil OCS exchange and restricted the model design
               to require only knowledge of soil moisture and surface
               temperature because remote sensing observations are available
               for these two features. Comparing the model to field-based
               chamber observations reveal deviations that can be attributed to
               missing complexity of the ground surface (having excluded litter

               the soil environment. For agricultural regions with known net

               demonstrate that data resolution can affect anticipated fluxes.
               We further investigate the influence of regions with unknown

               model to a process-based and respiration-based soil OCS exchange

              estimating the relative magnitude of the COS sources and sinks
              limit this approach. Sulfur isotope measurements (34S/32S;
              $\delta$34S) have been suggested as a useful tool to constrain
              COS sources. Yet such measurements are currently scarce for the
              atmosphere and absent for the marine source and the plant sink,
              which are two main fluxes. Here we present sulfur isotopes
              measurements of marine and atmospheric COS, and of plant-uptake
              fractionation experiments. These measurements resulted in a
              complete data-based tropospheric COS isotopic mass balance, which
              allows improved partition of the sources. We found an isotopic
              ($\delta$34S $\pm$ SE) value of 13.9 $\pm$ 0.1‰ for the
              troposphere, with an isotopic seasonal cycle driven by plant

               sulfur-containing gas in the atmosphere. Similar to CO2, COS
               main sink is the uptake by terrestrial plants. Therefore, COS is
               used as a proxy for CO2 uptake by terrestrial plants (gross
               primary production [GPP]). Currently, COS budget estimates have
               large uncertainties. Sulfur isotopes measurements are used in an
               isotopic mass-balance to constrain the COS budget. Here we
               conducted plant-chamber experiments for determining the isotopic
               fractionation during COS uptake by C3 and C4 plants, and that
               associated with enzymatic fractionation inside plant leaves. We
               also conducted COS diffusion in nitrogen experiment to determine
               the fractionation associated with COS diffusion through plant
               stomata. We then measured the $\delta$34S values of COS from

               fractionation of ?5.2 $\pm$ 0.5? for COS diffusion through plant

               scales. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) has emerged as a promising proxy
               to improve the representation of GPP in LSMs. Because COS is
               absorbed by vegetation following the same diffusion pathway as
               CO2 during photosynthesis and not emitted back to the
               atmosphere, incorporating a mechanistic representation of
               vegetation COS uptake in LSMs allows using COS observations to

               improve the representation of COS internal diffusion and
               consumption. Moreover, joint assimilation of ecosystem COS flux

               modeled vegetation COS uptake up to 18\%, but not GPP.

              inventory of COS developed by Zumkehr et al. (2018), Z-2018
              hereafter, is designed for a use by regional chemistry-transport
              models. In order to anticipate future applications at the
              regional scale, we carried out a first semiquantitative
              assessment of direct and indirect (i.e., from CS2 conversion) COS
              anthropogenic emissions at the sub-country scale in France using
              historical governmental data. Better agreement between the two
              inventories was found for direct emissions of COS by coal power
              plants, than for indirect sources. The use in this latter case of
              a sub-country spatial scaling, based on industrial N2O emissions,
              (1) strongly underestimates fluxes from food casings and
              cellulosic sponge industrial activities responsible for
              atmospheric CS2 emissions in France, and (2) considerably
              overestimates emissions from Paris and surrounding areas, which
              are free of a rayon industry. A list of food casings and
              cellulosic sponge industrial sites is provided to produce a more
              realistic inventory of CS2 sources in Europe. Nevertheless, a
              cluster analysis of wintertime air masses trajectories, with the
              atmospheric COS monitoring site of Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF) as end
              point, suggests that Z-2018 correctly identifies northern Germany
              and Belgium as sources of anthropogenic COS. In winter, when the
              wind blows from the NE sector, advection of anthropogenic COS
              from coal power plants is illustrated by synchronous variations
              in GIF and at the Trainou tall tower (distant of about 80 km) of
              a series of atmospheric pollution tracers, especially between COS
              and sulfates. These observations support the use of SO2 emissions
              as temporal and sub-country spatial scaling factors of COS
              emissions by the coal industry.",

               decreasing trend in the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) of the
               COS was observed for the first time in the Northern Hemisphere
               (−27 ppt over 6 years). The lowest SCA was recorded in 2021 (80
               ppt vs. 107 ppt in 2015). The trend in the SCA results revealed
               a steeper decline in the spring maximum than in that of the
               autumn minimum (−49 ppt vs. −10 ppt over 6 years, respectively).
               These negative trends were qualitatively consistent with those
               in the tropospheric COS put forward by the NDACC network of
               ground-based FTIR instruments, which were attributed to a
               slowing in the rate of COS anthropogenic emissions. Simulations
               using the ORCHIDEE land-surface model showed that a decrease in
               COS lowers the uptake of this gas by plants. Our observations
               suggest the existence of a causal relationship between the
               decline in the SCA and that in the tropospheric COS, implying
               that the temporal variations in the COS SCA over Western Europe
               are essentially driven by plant uptake. However, the transport
               by the LMDz 3-D model of surface fluxes for each component of
               the COS budget failed to reproduce this feature at GIF, pointing

               These data show that summertime OCS mixing ratios at low

               correlated with CO2. Although local plumes were observed on some

  abstract  = "Abstract. Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) has emerged as a valuable proxy
               for photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is known
               to be important in the formation of aerosols in the
               stratosphere. However, uncertainties in the global OCS budget
               remain large. This is mainly due to the following three flux
               terms: vegetation uptake, soil uptake and oceanic emissions.
               Bottom-up estimates do not yield a closed budget, which is
               thought to be due to tropical emissions of OCS that are not
               accounted for. Here we present a simulation of atmospheric OCS
               over the period 2004--2018 using the TOMCAT 3-D chemical
               transport model that is aimed at better constraining some terms
               in the OCS budget. Vegetative uptake of OCS is estimated by
               scaling gross primary productivity (GPP) output from the Joint
               UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) using the leaf relative
               uptake (LRU) approach. The remaining surface budget terms are
               taken from available literature flux inventories and adequately
               scaled to bring the budget into balance. The model is compared
               with limb-sounding satellite observations made by the
               Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment -- Fourier Transform
               Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and surface flask measurements from 14
               National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- Earth System
               Research Laboratory (NOAA-ESRL) sites worldwide. We find that
               calculating vegetative uptake using the LRU underestimates the
               surface seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) in the Northern
               Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes and high latitudes by
               approximately 37 ppt (35 \%). The inclusion of a large tropical
               source is able to balance the global budget, but further
               improvement to the SCA and phasing would likely require a flux
               inversion scheme. Compared to co-located ACE-FTS OCS profiles
               between 5 and 30 km, TOMCAT remains within 25 ppt (approximately
               5 \% of mean tropospheric concentration) of the measurements
               throughout the majority of this region and lies within the
               standard deviation of these measurements. This provides
               confidence in the representation of atmospheric loss and surface
               fluxes of OCS in the model. Atmospheric sinks account for 154 Gg
               S of the annual budget, which is 10 \%--50 \% larger than
               previous studies. Comparing the surface monthly anomalies from
               the NOAA-ESRL flask data to the model simulations shows a
               root-mean-square error range of 3.3--25.8 ppt. We estimate the
               total biosphere uptake to be 951 Gg S, which is in the range of
               recent inversion studies (893--1053 Gg S), but our terrestrial
               vegetation flux accounts for 629 Gg S of the annual budget,
               which is lower than other recent studies (657--756 Gg S).
               However, to close the budget, we compensate for this with a
               large annual oceanic emission term of 689 Gg S focused over the
               tropics, which is much larger than bottom-up estimates (285 Gg
               S). Hence, we agree with recent findings that missing OCS
               sources likely originate from the tropical region. This work
               shows that satellite OCS profiles offer a good constraint on
               atmospheric sinks of OCS through the troposphere and
               stratosphere and are therefore useful for helping to improve
               surface budget terms. This work also shows that the LRU approach
               is an adequate representation of the OCS vegetative uptake, but
               this method could be improved by various means, such as using a
               higher-resolution GPP product or plant-functional-type-dependent
               LRU. Future work will utilise TOMCAT in a formal inversion
               scheme to better quantify the OCS budget.",
